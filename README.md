* Composer (for PHP dependency management)
* MySQL
* Apache or Nginx (for local server)
* AWS CLI (if you are deploying on AWS EC2)
* Jenkins, Ansible, and Terraform (for CI/CD automation)

# CI/CD Pipeline:
* The project uses Jenkins for continuous integration and Terraform & Ansible for automated deployment and configuration management.
* Jenkins automates the building, testing, and deployment processes.
* Terraform is used to define the infrastructure as code (IaC) for provisioning and managing AWS resources.
* Ansible automates server configuration and application deployment.
* This ensures that every change is automatically tested, deployed, and ready for production with minimal human intervention.
